I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/) at the University of Mannheim. I am employed as a research associate at the [Chair of Comparative Government](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/debus/) teaching seminars on data collection, transformation, and visualization using R.

In my dissertation, I focus on (intra-) party competition and political behavior. Specifically, using computational methods, I study how and under what circumstances parties and politicians respond to the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, I investigate climate change related trade-offs using survey data.

Feel free to reach out via e-mail, Twitter, or LinkedIn if your are interested in my research.
